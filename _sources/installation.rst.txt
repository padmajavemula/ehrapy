Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

To install ehrapy, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install ehrapy

This is the preferred method to install ehrapy, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide you through the process.

If you intend to run MedCAT you have to install a language model like:
.. code-block:: console

    $ python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

.. _pip: https://pip.pypa.io
.. _Python installation guide: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/

Please note that you require `poetry`_ to be installed.

You can either clone the public repository:

Or download the `tarball`_:
